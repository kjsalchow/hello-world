Hello World!
This is Ken.  I've been in technology for over 30 years mostly as a hardware/network guy, but I've also done numerous coding projects along the way.  I'm finalizing my dissertation for a doctorate of business technology and am starting work in updating my data science knowledge as well.
My exploration into data science is getting me into R, which oddly brings me back to some of my coding roots from way, way back.  And now, I'm here.
